<h1>📜 Rules of Betting – Read Before You Wager!</h1>
<ol>
  <li><strong>It's All for Fun 🎉</strong> – Just for friends and entertainment. No real money involved.</li>
  <li><strong>Start With 1000 Credits 💰</strong> – Use wisely. Once it’s gone, ask an admin (politely!) for a top-up.</li>
  <li><strong>Check the Odds 🎲</strong> – Higher odds = bigger payouts, riskier bets!</li>
  <li><strong>Unlimited Outcomes 🔄</strong> – Events can have more than 2 possible results. Choose wisely.</li>
  <li><strong>Bet Responsibly 🎯</strong> – Don’t put all credits on one wild hunch… unless you like drama.</li>
  <li><strong>Pending Bets ⏳</strong> – Bets stay pending until an admin resolves the event.</li>
  <li><strong>Winnings 🚀</strong> – Win = stake × odds added to your balance.</li>
  <li><strong>Respect the Admin 👑</strong> – Admin’s word is final. Snacks may increase luck 😉.</li>
  <li><strong>Have Fun! 🎊</strong> – Bet smart, laugh loud, keep it friendly!</li>
</ol>
